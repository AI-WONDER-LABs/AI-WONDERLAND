[#how-many-jobs-can-run-concurrently]
=== How many jobs can I run concurrently?

The number of jobs you can run concurrently differs between link:https://circleci.com/pricing/[plans]. When using workflows to schedule jobs, you can use a xref:guides:orchestrate:workflows.adoc#fan-outfan-in-workflow[fan-out/fan-in method] to run jobs concurrently.

[#use-multiple-executor-types-same-workflow]
=== Can I use multiple executor types in the same workflow?

Yes, this is supported. See the xref:guides:toolkit:sample-config.adoc#sample-configuration-with-multiple-executor-types[Sample configuration] page for examples.

[#build-only-the-jobs-that-changed]
=== Can I build only the jobs that changed?

You can set up your workflows to conditionally run jobs based on specific updates to your repository. You can do this with xref:guides:orchestrate:pipeline-variables.adoc#conditional-workflows[Conditional workflows] and xref:guides:orchestrate:dynamic-config.adoc#[Dynamic configurations]. Dynamic configurations will dynamically generate CircleCI configuration and pipeline parameters, and run the resulting work within the same pipeline.
