= Using tables

== Basic table syntax
Use the following format for tables:

[source,adoc]
----
[cols=4*, options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Required
| Type
| Description

| Version
| Y
| String
| Should currently be `2`
|===
----

Looks like:

[cols=4*, options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Required
| Type
| Description

| Version
| Y
| String
| Should currently be `2`
|===

== Extra wide tables

If you have a wide table that needs to scroll, wrap it in a scrollable container, as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
[.table-scroll]
--
[cols=4*, options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Required
| Type
| Description

| ++Some+very+long+text+that+can't+wrap+so+the+table+needs+to+scroll+Some+very+long+text+that+can't+wrap+so+the+table+needs+to+scroll++
| Some data
| Some more data
| Some more data
|===

[cols=4*, options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Required
| Type
| Description

| ++Some+very+long+text+that+can't+wrap+so+the+table+needs+to+scroll+Some+very+long+text+that+can't+wrap+so+the+table+needs+to+scroll++
